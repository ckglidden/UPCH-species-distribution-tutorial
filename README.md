# UPCH geospatial analysis workshop
# Species distribution modeling tutorial
> This github page includes a tutorial of how to model the distribution of XX species using MAPBIOMAS land-use/land-cover data.


## 1. Uploading point data to GEE :mosquito:

a. download occurrence dataset (XYZ - csv file available on this github page)

b. upload occurrence dataset as an assett


## 2. Downloading MAPBIOMAS data :earth_americas:

Maybe include a screengrab of MAPBIOMAS?

Link to MAPBIOMAS website & Link to legend for code

a. navigate to Caroline's GEE code - in this code you will upload the assett, specifiy the output file & directory, and choose the LULC and years you want to download data for


## 3. Clean MAPBIOMAS data :broom:

a. cleaning code chunk - maybe take average of LULC over a ten year period for simplicty sake?
